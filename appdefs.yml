      dupeGuru is a tool to find duplicate files on your computer. It can scan either
      filenames or contents. The filename scan features a fuzzy matching algorithm
      that can find duplicate filenames even when they are not exactly the same.

      - title: dupeGuru Deletion Options
        level: 2
        content: |-
          When deleting duplicated files, dupeGuru offer two choices:
            * Send files to trash
            * Delete files directly

          The first option moves files to the `/trash` directory inside the container.
          This operation can be slow for large files since it may imply a copy of the
          data before the actual deletion.

          There is also an option to link deleted files.  It is not recommended to enable
          this option, since there is a good chance that created links won't make sense
          outside the container.
